This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function. The problem arises from inconsistencies in unit usage and potential browser compatibility issues.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, showing how `calc()` can produce unexpected results.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a corrected version illustrating how to use `calc()` correctly to avoid the issue. 

The issue is highlighted in the readme with examples.  Best practices for using `calc()` are also included for better understanding and future development.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.  You should see the unexpected layout or positioning.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` (if provided) to compare with the corrected implementation.
