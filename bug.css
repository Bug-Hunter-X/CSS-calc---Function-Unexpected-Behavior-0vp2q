The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if used incorrectly. For instance, if you try to use `calc()` with percentages and absolute units without proper consideration of the context, it may not behave as expected. Another issue can arise when combining `calc()` with different units within the same expression, leading to rendering inconsistencies.  Additionally, browser compatibility issues might emerge with more complex `calc()` expressions, causing unexpected behavior in older browsers.  Using `calc()` inside media queries also requires careful attention to unit consistency.
